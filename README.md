# Monte-Carlo-for-integrals
该程序使用Python编写，采用蒙特卡洛方法计算定积分，主要有两种思路。第一种方法是通过函数的平均值来计算积分，在区间[a,b]上均匀取N个随机样本Xi，计算g(Xi)并求平均值，得到的相当于Y坐标值，然后乘以(b-a)作为X坐标长度，得出对应矩形的面积，即为积分值。第二种方法是使用随机投点法，在积分区间内随机投点，计算在积分函数下的点所占比例，并乘以正方形面积，就是函数的积分值。代码中有详细注释，以帮助您更好地理解。

The program is written in Python and uses the Monte Carlo method to calculate definite integrals, with two main approaches. The first method calculates the integral by taking the average value of the function. N random samples Xi are uniformly taken from the interval [a, b], g(Xi) is calculated and averaged, giving the Y-coordinate value. Then it is multiplied by (b-a) for the X-coordinate length, resulting in the area of the corresponding rectangle, which is the value of the integral. The second method uses a random point throwing approach. Points are randomly thrown in the integral interval, calculating the ratio of points below the integral function to all points, then multiplying it by the area of the square to obtain the value of the integral. The code has detailed comments for better understanding.
